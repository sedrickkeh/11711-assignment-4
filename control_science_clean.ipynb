            "74 3 This is a sentence about science and technology. A great man died before he had time to write something. And he wrote a great book called Life and Death. We're talking long life, great achievements, and people die of natural causes. It's just incredible. In fact, scientists would call this an example of evolution. It's basically a scientific explanation of the laws of nature, but it doesn't claim to be more scientific than other explanations. It's just one more attempt to get some science\n",
